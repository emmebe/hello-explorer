      <h2>About the Earth</h2>
      <p>Earth fell in love the moment the Moon stayed. In a universe built on passing orbits, the Moon chose to circle, and Earth learned what it meant to be seen.</p>
      <p>Earth spins so the Moon can watch every side of her—oceans flashing silver, clouds drifting like unspoken thoughts. Her gravity reaches outward, holding the Moon close without ever touching, a promise written in force instead of words. Together they keep time: tides rise and fall, nights glow softly, and life below learns rhythm from their endless dance.</p>
