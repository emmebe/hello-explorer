      <h2>About the Moon</h2>
      <p>The Moon loves quietly. It does not speak or shine on its own, but it never leaves.</p>
      <p>The Moon reflects Earth’s light back to her, night after night, phase after phase. Locked in orbit, always showing the same face, it bears the scars of time so Earth does not have to. Its pull steadies her tilt, calms her spin, and guards her from drifting alone. In return, the Moon asks for nothing—only to remain, circling, faithful in the dark.</p>
